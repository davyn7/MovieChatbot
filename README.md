# MovieChatbot

## Description
Built a fully-functioning chatbot using Python to recommend movies for my CS 124 Final Project.

## Features:
- Identifying movies with wrong capitalization and spelling, in addition to identifying movies with alternate/foreign titles
- Fine-grained sentiment extraction with multiple-movie input to determine whether or not a user likes the movie(s)
- Disambiguation of complex responses, such as responses referring to ordering or containing extraneous words
- Identifying and responding to arbitrary inputs and emotions
- Understanding references to things said previously in the conversation
- Generating a movie recommendation, can generate more recommendations if the user rejects the prior recommendation
- Speaking fluently: dialogues for spell-checking, disambiguation, etc.
